## Description
Snap It! is a photo-album sharing website where users can create public or private albums to share with others.  Public albums will be available for viewing among all users, whereas private albums are only viewable by people on a user's friends list.  At the landing page, users will have the option to login or register for an account.  Once logged in or registered, they will be taken to a dashboard where their favorite albums will be loaded.  In a side bar will be their friends list.  If a user is new and has no albums listed as their favorites, a random assortment of public albums will appear on their dashboard.  All public albums will have the ability to be saved as a favorite. Private albums can only be viewed and saved as favorites by users listed as friends. Once an album is clicked, the photos in the album will be populated on a left hand side bar, with a close up of each image populated in the middle of the screen when the image in the side bar is clicked.  Once on an individual photo, there will be an option to comment on the photo. On a user's dashboard will also be the ability to create an album and upload pictures to the album. Once an album is created a user can set whether the album is public or private and which friends can see the album and also whether others can add images to the album.  For instance, a user may start a pets album with pictures of his pets but allow other users to share pictures of their pets in the public pets album.  Users could create albums for fashion, cars, home decor, or any other topic.  In addition, some users may use Snap It! to just share family albums with other friends and family in a more private forum than regular social media.
